A Kaggle competition to predict house prices involves participants using machine learning techniques to develop models that accurately estimate the costs of residential properties. The competition typically provides a dataset containing various features or attributes of houses, such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical sales data.

By utilizing scikit-learn components, I could build a pipeline that handles preprocessing, missing value imputation, categorical encoding, and regression modelling to predict house prices accurately.
