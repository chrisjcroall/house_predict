# house_predict

A Kaggle competition to predict house prices involves participants using machine learning techniques to develop models that accurately estimate the prices of residential properties. The competition typically provides a dataset containing various features or attributes of houses, such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical sales data.

To predict house prices, I made use of the following components from scikit-learn:

ColumnTransformer from sklearn.compose: It helps in preprocessing and transforming different columns of the dataset separately. This is useful when we have a mix of numerical and categorical features that require different preprocessing steps.

RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble: It is an ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to predict the target variable. RandomForestRegressor is commonly used for regression tasks, such as predicting house prices.

Pipeline from sklearn.pipeline: It allows us to chain multiple steps together and streamline the workflow. In this case, we can create a pipeline that combines preprocessing steps with the RandomForestRegressor model.

r2_score from sklearn.metrics: It is a commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of regression models. The r2_score calculates the coefficient of determination, which measures how well the predicted values fit the actual values.

SimpleImputer from sklearn.impute: It helps in handling missing values in the dataset. We can use SimpleImputer to fill in the missing values with either the mean, median, or a constant value.

OneHotEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing: It is used to encode categorical features into numeric values. OneHotEncoder creates binary columns for each category, representing whether a particular category is present or not.

By utilizing these scikit-learn components, we can build a pipeline that handles preprocessing, missing value imputation, categorical encoding, and regression modeling to predict house prices accurately.
